## My Portfolio - James Macalino

### The purpose of my portfolio is to showcase some of the coding work and web design work I have completed so far.  As you can tell, my portfolio is a work in progress and I plan to continue to make changes to the presentation layer as well as add content as I progress through the MIT xPro course.  I plan to use this time to both orient myself to coding, specifically with html, css, and JS as well as an opportunity to grow and nurture my new skillset. 

### I feature three current projects that I completed as part of the Certification Program through MIT xPRO studying full-stack coding/MERN method.

## eye movement exercise 
  --when the program is executed, the eyes follow the mouse cursor
## real time bus tracker exercise
  --when the title bar at the top of the display is engaged, the viewer is shown the bus route in real time
## pacmen 
  --when the program is executed, the player should initially press the "Start" bar to initiate the game then press "Add Pacman" button.  Subsequent presses of either bar increases the velocity of pacman and adds another pacman respectively.
